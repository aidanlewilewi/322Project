The data set takes into account the distance they flew, they travel class they sat in, if there was a delay, etc. Using this data we are going to try to classify whether the passenger was 'satisfied' or 'neutral or dissatisfied' with their expereince. \n",

    "### Data Attributes \n",
    "There are twenty-five total attributes in this data set: \n",
    "* **Gender:** Gender of the passengers (Female, Male)\n",
    "* **Customer Type:** The customer type (Loyal customer, disloyal customer)\n",
    "* **Age:** The actual age of the passengers\n",

    "* **Class:** Travel class in the plane of the passengers (Business, Eco, Eco Plus)\n",
    "* **Flight distance:** The flight distance of this journey\n",
    "* **Inflight wifi service:** Satisfaction level of the inflight wifi service (0:Not Applicable;1-5)\n",
    "* **Departure/Arrival time convenient:** Satisfaction level of Departure/Arrival time convenient\n",
    "* **Ease of Online booking:** Satisfaction level of online booking\n",
    "* **Gate location:** Satisfaction level of Gate location\n",
    "* **Food and drink:** Satisfaction level of Food and drink\n",
    "* **Online boarding:** Satisfaction level of online boarding\n",
    "* **Seat comfort:** Satisfaction level of Seat comfort\n",

    "### Data Cleaning\n",
    "While most of these attributes were categorical there are a few that were not, including distance of flight and age. In order to prune our tree some we changed both of these to categorical. To do this we computed what 5 equal bins would be for that data and then assigned each instance a label 1-5 depending on which bin they fell into. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing we did to clean our data was to take a random subsample. The data set that we downloaded had upwards of 103,000 instances. We wanted to use just 1,000. To get a random sample, first removed rows with missing values, trimming the dataset down to about 30,000 rows. Then, we shuffled the indices of the data and then made a new dataset with the first 1000 indices. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary Stats\n",
    "Some important statistics to point out about our data is that approximately 51% of the respondants were female and approximately 49% were male, a relatively equal distribution between male and female respondants. Furthermore, 82% were loyal customers and 18% were disloyal customers. The majority of passengers were flying for business purposes (69%) and less so for personal travel (31%). Overall we saw that 37% of customers were satisfied with their experience and 63% were neutral or dissatidfied. One area that we looked at more closely was the satisfaction based on the class the passenger was in. For economy passengers, 87.7% were neutral or dissatisfied and 12.3% were satisfied. For economy plus passengers, 83.4% were neutral or dissatisfied and 16.6% were satisfied. For business class passengers, 37% were neutral or dissatisfied and 63% were satisfied.\n"
