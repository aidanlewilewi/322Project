# 322Project
CPSC 322 Final Project

# Project Description 
Our project looks into the satisfaction levels of thousands of airline passengers. These passengers have filled out surveys about their 
flight expereince and whether or not they are satisfied. The attributes in this table includes: sex of passenger, class they flew in, distance they flew, 
if the flight was delayed, etc. Using these atrributes we can build different classifiers like decision trees to classify unseen instances as either 
satisfied or neutral or dissatisfied.
