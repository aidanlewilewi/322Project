    "In this project we are using data collected about airline passengers and their satisfaction levels with their experience. The data set takes into account the distance they flew, they travel class they sat in, if there was a delay, etc. Using this data we are going to try to classify whether the passenger was 'satisfied' or 'neutral or dissatisfied' with their expereince. \n",

    "### Data Cleaning\n",
    "While most of these attributes were categorical there are two that were not, distance of flight and age. In order to prune our tree some we changed both of these to categorical. To do this we computed what 5 equal bins would be for that data and then assigned each instance a label 1-5 depending on which bin they fell into. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing we did to clean our data was to take a random subsample. The data set that we downloaded had upwards of 103,000 instances. We wanted to use just 1,000. To get a random sample, we shuffled the indices of the data and then made a new dataset with the first 1000 indices. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary Stats\n",
    "Some important statistics to point out about our data is that 51% of the respondants were female and 49% we male, a relatively equal distribution between male and female respondants. Furthermore, 82% were loyal customers and 18% were disloyal customers. The majority of passengers were flying for business purposes (69%) and less so for personal travel (31%). Overall we saw that 37% of customers were satisfied with their experience and 63% were neautral or dissatidfied. One area that we looked at more closely was the satisfaction based on the class the passenger was in. For economy passengers, 87.1% were neautral or dissatisfied and 12.9% were satisfied. For economy plus passengers, 83% were neautral or dissatisfied and 17% were satisfied. For business class passengers, 37.5% were neautral or dissatisfied and 62.5% were satisfied.\n"
